# Predicting the price for an Airbnb Host in Berlin

In Germany, no city is more popular than Berlin. That implies that Berlin is one of the hottest markets for Airbnb in Europe,
with over 22,552 listings as of November 2018. With a size of 891 km², this means there are roughly 25 homes being rented out per km² in Berlin on Airbnb!

The following question will drive this project:

> **Can we determine a fairly spot-on daily price for a new accommodation that fits into its specific market environment and competitors in Berlin?** <br>

The question focuses on the accommodation features and decisions a new host can make with regards to initial presentation, i.e. posting a picture of him- or herself on the website, determining a minimum length of stay, offering instant bookings etc. A machine learning algorithm will be applied to try to get an answer.
